      Our commitment to clear communication throughout the entire process sets us apart, that's why it is requisite to start every new funding procedure by drawing up a professional Pitchbook. It serves as a comprehensive guide, outlining the investment opportunity, its associated risks, and critical details that our European partners need to make informed decisions. We operate exclusively on a "no introduction, no fees" basis! This means that our office in Groningen will only charge costs for creating the Pitchbook after a successful introduction.
